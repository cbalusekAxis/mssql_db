For setting up the MsSQL server, you can run the docker compose file to spin up the mdb_db.
However, the primary concern is that there is no persistent volume.
So, we can create a docker volume container to hold this information in the interim.

We can add this volume to our docker-compose file as 
'''
  sdc:
    volumes:
      - 'db_data:/data'

  volumes:
    - db_data:
'''
This will create a virtual volume on the docker MobyLinuxVM whhich will be maintained by Docker.
You can bind directly to the local machine as well but this is not advised.

The bigger idea then becomes what are you attempting to do?  A volume can have permissions changed to RW or R-only.
This can be immensely beneficial for something like a database which needs RW capability but R-only for things accessing the database.
